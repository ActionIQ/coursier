## JVM

The `bootstrap` command generates tiny bootstrap launchers, able to pull their dependencies from
repositories on first launch. For example, the launcher of coursier is [generated](https://github.com/coursier/coursier/blob/master/scripts/generate-launcher.sh) with a command like
```bash
$ ./coursier bootstrap \
    io.get-coursier:coursier-cli_2.11:1.0.3 \
    -f -o coursier
```

See `./coursier bootstrap --help` for a list of the available options.

## Native

The `bootstrap` command can also generate native executables via [scala-native](http://scala-native.org). This requires the corresponding scala-native app to publish its JARs, on Maven Central for example, and your environment to be [set up for scala-native](http://www.scala-native.org/en/latest/user/setup.html). One can then generate executables with a command like
```bash
$ ./coursier bootstrap \
    --native \
    io.get-coursier:echo_native0.3_2.11:1.0.2 \
    -o echo-native

$ ./echo-native hey
