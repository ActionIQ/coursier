coursier `1.1.0-M11` was just released.
This release contains [numerous enhancements](#tweaking-enhancements) both in
the core of coursier and its CLI, along with [a few fixes](#fixes) for the CLI.

It occurs in the midst of the addition of the higher level API for coursier,
that should be discussed in a later release.
This higher level API aims at being as simple to use as the CLI of coursier.

> The `resolve`, `fetch`, and `launch` commands were heavily refactored,
to extract bits of the high level API from them. Although best efforts were made
to prevent them, these refactoring may come with some regressions. Don't
hesitate to report any if ever you run into one.

## Tweaking / enhancements

### Optimizations

Regular expressions were used during resolution to process Maven properties.
Some handcrafted code now handles those, which provides nice
[performance gains](https://github.com/coursier/coursier/pull/1026#issuecomment-456380505).

Maven POM parsing used to be handled by parsing the POM file itself, then
processing the resulting XML AST. It's now handled by a SAX parser, which
brought some [performance gains](https://github.com/coursier/coursier/pull/1029#issuecomment-456832973) too.

### Default repositories

In the CLI, and in the upcoming high level API, the default repositories are
- the local Ivy2 repository (`~/.ivy2/local`),
- [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2).

These can now be tweaked via the environment, via
- `COURSIER_REPOSITORIES` in the environment,
- the `coursier.repositories` Java property.

This environment variable or Java property are expected to contain a list
of repositories, separated by `|`, like `central|sonatype:releases`.
The repositories themselves are parsed the same way as those passed via
the `-r` or `--repository` options of the CLI.

Note that this does _not_ affect the sbt plugin.

### CLI

#### Download initial JAR from Central rather than Sonatype releases

The coursier launcher downloads [a proguarded version](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/get-coursier/coursier-cli_2.12/1.1.0-M11/coursier-cli_2.12-1.1.0-M11-standalone.jar)
of the CLI of coursier upon first launch. It is now ensured this proguarded JAR is downloaded
from [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2), rather than
[Sonatype releases](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases),
the former being usually faster than the latter.

#### Ship completions with launcher

The completions of coursier now ship with the launcher itself. Run
```bash
$ coursier --completions zsh
```
to print the Zsh ones. (Zsh is the only supported shell for now.)

#### `--sbt-plugin` option

The `resolve` and `fetch` commands now accept a `--sbt-plugin` option to
accept sbt plugin dependencies. Use like
```bash
$ coursier resolve --sbt-plugin com.typesafe.sbt:sbt-native-packager:1.3.3
```

Adjust the scala and sbt versions with the `--scala-version` and `sbt-version`
options, like
```bash
$ coursier resolve \
    --sbt-plugin com.typesafe.sbt:sbt-native-packager:1.3.3 \
    --scala-version 2.10.7 \
    --sbt-version 0.13.8
```

#### Don't automatically resolve unrecognized dependencies against Scaladex

Formerly, things passed to the CLI not recognized as dependencies were
assumed to be [Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org) queries, like
```bash
$ coursier launch ammonite
```
(Note that the Scaladex resolves this against the wrong module for now.)

Scaladex queries now have to be passed explicitly, like
```bash
$ coursier launch --scaladex ammonite
```

#### Conflicts handling from CLI (work in progress)

The `resolve` command can now print potential conflicts among dependencies, like
```bash
$ coursier resolve io.get-coursier:coursier-cli_2.12:1.1.0-M10 --conflicts
org.scala-lang:scala-library:2.12.8 was selected, but
  com.chuusai:shapeless_2.12:2.3.3                                wanted version 2.12.4
  com.github.alexarchambault:argonaut-shapeless_6.2_2.12:1.2.0-M8 wanted version 2.12.4
  com.github.alexarchambault:case-app-annotations_2.12:2.0.0-M5   wanted version 2.12.7
  com.github.alexarchambault:case-app-util_2.12:2.0.0-M5          wanted version 2.12.7
  com.github.alexarchambault:case-app_2.12:2.0.0-M5               wanted version 2.12.7
  org.scala-lang:scala-reflect:2.12.6                             wanted version 2.12.6
  org.scala-lang.modules:scala-xml_2.12:1.1.1                     wanted version 2.12.6
  org.typelevel:cats-core_2.12:1.5.0                              wanted version 2.12.7
  org.typelevel:cats-kernel_2.12:1.5.0                            wanted version 2.12.7
  org.typelevel:cats-macros_2.12:1.5.0                            wanted version 2.12.7
  org.typelevel:machinist_2.12:0.6.6                              wanted version 2.12.6
  org.typelevel:macro-compat_2.12:1.1.1                           wanted version 2.12.0

org.scala-lang:scala-reflect:2.12.6 was selected, but
  io.argonaut:argonaut_2.12:6.2.1 wanted version 2.12.4

```

Pass `--fail-if-conflicts` to have a non-zero exit code in case of conflicts.

Beware that these options are a work in progress, more options to filter out
conflicts should be added in the future.

#### Reworked bootstrap launchers

The launchers generated by the `bootstrap` command underwent significant
changes, most notably the "standalone" launchers.

Standalone launchers contain the JARs they're supposed to launch as resources.
Previously, they were setting up a custom
`java.net.URLStreamHandlerFactory`, to handle custom URL protocols for
these JARs. This is no longer the case. Thanks to bits of code imported
from the [Spring boot loader](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/32b14f30987c4fb40d1ac69ecba47c7b876b60ce/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-loader/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/loader/jar),
these JARs are handled via the `jar` protocol, resulting in URLs like
`jar:file:â€¦!/`. The logic imported from Spring also has the advantage
of exposing those JARs to `java.net.URLClassLoader` in a way allowing
for a performance on par with standard files.

## Fixes

#### Fix stack overflow when printing trees with cyclic dependencies

Regression since `1.1.0-M2`. For example, the following command works again
```bash
$ coursier resolve -t \
    -r http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/m2repo \
    edu.illinois.cs.cogcomp:illinois-nlp-pipeline:0.1.21
```

#### Fail loudly on interrupted downloads from the launcher

The coursier launcher, and the bootstraps it generates, can download some JARs
upon first launch. These downloads rely on `java.net.HttpURLConnection` for
http and https, which sometimes succeeds even if the connection is abruptly
interrupted, resulting in invalid JARs. These are now detected in the launcher,
which then requests users to try running the launcher again.
